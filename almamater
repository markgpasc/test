In green Manoa Valley our Alma Mater stands
Where mountain winds and showers refresh her fertile lands;
The flag of freedom beckons above her shining halls,
To larger truth and service our Alma Mater calls.



Our loyal priase we tender, and pledge to hold thy aim,
Till ocean's far horizons shall hear thy honored name.
